# Learning Rust

Code snippets and other stuff from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book).

Yay learning!

## How this repo works

All final code from each chapter will be in its respective chapter folder with comments and explanations. Since the source of the project is still `src/main.rs` I duplicate the code depending on the chapter I'm on for personal use and testing.
