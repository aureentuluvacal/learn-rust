// Modules can be nested like files in directories.
// By default, modules, their functions and its contents
// are private. We need to add the keyword "pub" to make it accessible.

// I can access parent module contents but not child module contents.
// Adding "pub" to structs makes the struct public but not its fields.
// Adding "pub" to enums makes its variants public as well.
