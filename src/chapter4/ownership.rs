// Just gonna rip out a paragraph from the book:
//
// "Some languages have garbage collection that constantly looks for no longer used
// memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly 
// allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed 
// through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at 
// compile time."
//
// The first approach is like JS, the second like C.
